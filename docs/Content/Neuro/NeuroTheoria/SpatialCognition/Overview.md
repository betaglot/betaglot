## Ontario Curriculum

[Grade 5: Geometric and Spatial Reasoning](https://www.dcp.edu.gov.on.ca/en/curriculum/elementary-mathematics/grades/g5-math/strand-e/e1)

> In this strand, students analyse the **properties** of shapes ‚Äì the **elements** that **define** a **shape** and make it unique ‚Äì and use these **properties** to **define**, **compare**, and **construct** **shapes** and **objects**, as well as to explore relationships among properties. Students begin with an intuition about their surroundings and the objects in them, and learn to **visualize objects from different perspectives**. Over time, students develop an increasingly sophisticated **understanding of size, shape, location, movement, and change, in both two and three dimensions**. They understand and choose appropriate **units** to **estimate, measure, and compare attributes**, and they use appropriate tools to make measurements. They apply their understanding of the relationships between **shapes** and measurement to develop formulas to **calculate length, area, volume**, and more.
