Write a python script to convert the config into a json that D3 treemap can use. So you don't have to worry about updating both

There shouldn't be a node called overview, so use the name in the sidebar, not the file name

### Example of an Object's Value

- Text
    - RequiredMoto
    - Force required
    - Direction of travel
    - Instruction for what to do next.
- Number
    - Density
    - TreeCount
    - ViaSequenceNumber
    - MotoPhraseNumber
    - StepCount
- Location
    - TargetLocation in the Eco.
    - PotentialMicrosite
    -
- Array
    - MotoPhrase
    - Set of Submotos
    - ViaSequence

### Outcome > Output

False value is a bunch of features that Planters don't use. The value of a stump is not its color (HexadecimalValue, RGB values), rather value comes from the stump's PotentialMicrosites. The ViaFactor(PotentialMicrosite, FlagSite) gives the EcoFactor(Stump) value

Theorem the name of an object, while Problem is the object's values and methods.

### Value Exchange

The value exchange of woven fiber neighbors is the tension force holding each other in place. Warp Weft. ForceExchange.

Subsystems give each other value.

The ViaFactor(GoodMicrosite, FlagSite) gives the EcoFactor(Stump) value. The stump gives Via value by providing PotentialMicrosite.

The exchange doesn't need to be mutually beneficial. Both ValueAddition or (ValueAddition + ValueSubtraction).

What does paired Object get in return?

### Value Chain

Also known as a Value Stream.

Value is added along a Phrase of steps. Like Bioamplification of poison in Predatory Birds

- Exponential
- [Addition of MarginalGains Infographic]

### MotoFactorValue

::: tip MotoFactorValue Addition

---

#### Moto Saves Time

- FlagMoto while Walking away.
- Use one forceful ScreefMoto instead of many weak ScreefMotos.
- FootScreef a thin DuffLayer instead of bending over to SpadeScreef.

#### Moto Simplifies

- MotoShape
- HighFlag your LineIn to make it easier for the Planter in a neighbouring piece to see their piece boundary lines.

#### Moto Reduces Risk

- SpadeProbe the soil to reduce the risk of hurting your wrist by hitting a subsurface rock.
- Reduce the risk of injury by learning how to fall properly.
- Use ArmBalance to reduce the risk of Falling.

#### Moto Connects

- AbsorbMoto allows smooth transitions between Motos.
- Use ArmAbsorb to redirect Spade during SpadeMotos.

#### Moto Reduces Effort

- Remove Clothing Layer to reduce your body's need for sweat.
- Stick Spade in the ground when you get to the cache to avoid having to pick it up from the ground when you return to the Eco.

#### Moto Avoids Hassles

- BodyRotate before BodySlot to prevent BagSnag
- Any Snag is a hassle
- ArmBlock to prevent getting hit with a branch in the face.
- Adjust your bags to avoid getting abraisions on your hips.

#### Moto Reduces Cost

- Flag is a cost in money terms and Planter resources too.

#### Moto Increases Variety

- HandClose is more versitile than FootClose.

#### Moto SensoryAppeal

- Not listening to music with headphones, so you can hear the Attributes of the soil.

#### Moto Informs

- SpadeProbe to feel the ground instead of only using vision for MicrositeSelection.

#### Moto Access

- Fold a plant out of the way of Hole.
- Moto a branch out of the way when walking through Slash or a residual patch.

#### Moto Increases Effort

- Climbing over a SlashPile instead of going around it.

#### Moto EmbracesHassles

#### Moto IncreasesCost

- FlagRipError so that the flag is longer than it needs to be.

#### Moto Reduces Variety

- LimitedRangeOfMotion
- Tight Clothing
- Not planting Ambidextrously

#### Moto Obscures (SensoryAppeal)

- ThickGloves so you can't feel your PlantingHand
- HiddenByPlanter
    - You can't see the hole because your arm is in the way

#### Moto Disinforms

#### Moto RemovesAccess

- HoleCollapse

MotoSelection.MotoEvaluation
    - "Is that the **best** move for the current BetaInstance"
    - Neuro.Judgement
        - All evaluations are judgements. See Kahneman
    - What is the most valuable move gi
    - Which move solves the current state?

- Energy to move.
- Knowing where to go
    - Via
- Knowing how to move
    - MotoSelection

- Required Tools
    - A spade is more valuable than an extractor since it can solve more problems more efficiently. A spade solves the same problems as an extractor and can solve even more problems than an extractor.
