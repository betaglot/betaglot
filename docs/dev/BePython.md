# BePython

Build a Computational Model of Beta

::: warning

UsePython code will be on github (where the programmers are), BePython is for non-programmers

## What is Computation?

Define BetaFactor classes for BePython instead of UsePython. UsePython will change UI or state. BePython is implemented in humans, UsePython is implemented digitally.

BePython only outputs information that is designed to be read by humans. UsePython outputs non human readable information like JSON.

UsePython is a superset of BePython.

BePython has alot of f strings

class Arm(Moto):

> Computer

## Klimbeta.py

Climb({})

Insert the route

Route is composed of Via and Eco and sometimes Moto if for the StartPosition

Pass a Route as an argument to the Climb() method

Users can use a form instead of writing a dict

## BePython, Analogy between Python and Planting

> Your best Python code won't even run digitally. It will be implemented in and by humans.

Be like a Dune mentat.

| Python | Put(Plant) |
| ------ | --------- |
| user   | Eco       |
| input  | |
| output | |

math
conditional execution |

### Algorithm

### Data

### Input/Output

#### Return Value

Motos return force

MotoFunction

```py
def move(move{}, eco{}, via{}, neuro):
    force = (Submoto{} + Submoto{})
    return force
```

## Simulator

- Use Simulation to model motos. Ultimately the goal is to have a planter coded in Unity.
- 3D model of planter
- 3D model of all objects in Put(Plant).
- So kids who game can learn the computations of Computational Planting, before they are old enough to work as a planter.

## Computational Neuroscience

## Computational Geometry

> Computational geometry is a branch of computer science devoted to the study of algorithms which can be stated in terms of geometry. Some purely geometrical problems arise out of the study of computational geometric algorithms, and such problems are also considered to be part of computational geometry.

### Graph Theory

- Nearest Neighbor
- Minimum Spanning Tree

### Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation

## Computer Science

- What are the computations that planters use?
- Just like Python, all objects in a planter's experience are objects.

## OOP

Object Oriented Programming

> A mathematical object is an abstract concept arising in mathematics. In the usual language of mathematics, an object is anything that has been (or could be) formally defined, and with which one may do deductive reasoning and mathematical proofs. Typically, a mathematical object can be a value that can be assigned to a variable, and therefore can be involved in formulas. Commonly encountered mathematical objects include numbers, sets, functions, expressions, geometric objects, transformations of other mathematical objects, and spaces. Mathematical objects can be very complex; for example, theorems, proofs, and even theories are considered as mathematical objects in proof theory.

I want to call Beta Objects Elements to align with gymnastics, since they call their Gymnast units of performance Elements. `{ Gymnastics : Put(Plant) }`

All functions are Objects

A Moto is an Object of Movement

- ArmSwing()

An Eco is an Object of the Environment

- TrenchLand

A Neuro is an Object of the Nervous system

A Beta is an Object of Beta.

- Put() is a Beta
- Beta.Lingo()
    - BetaLingo is like print() or console.log()

When someone asks "What's your Beta?" you don't give them your Beta since Beta requires execution, instead you give them a description of Beta. All code is actually the movement of electricity, but it's represented as text. Really what the person is asking is "What is a description of your Beta?"

Beta can be represented as Plantbeta, or BetaVox

You can't speak about Via or Moto by themselves.

An Element is an Object of Put(Plant).

- BetaElement and Put(Plant)Element have been confused. Beta can be applied to Climbing, Put(Plant) can not. You don't need Beta to climb. Beta is an abstraction layer on top of Climbing or Planting. Beta is the observation

- BETAMETRON

Beta is the method that you use, but also the communication of that method. There needs to be another word for the communication. BetaLingua

The BetaLingo of balance beam

> "<moto>Jump</moto> <via>on</via> the <eco>beam</eco> <via>at the middle</via>, then <moto>step</moto> <via>backwards</via>"

### <beta>BetaElement: Object</beta>

```py

Beta_Attributes = {

}

```

### <eco>EcoFactor: Object</eco>

```py

Eco_Attributes = {
    'material': string,

}

```

### <moto>MotoFactor: Object</moto>

```py

Moto_Attributes = {
    
}

```

### <via>ViaFactor: Object</via>

```py

Via_Attributes = {

}

```

### <neuro>NeuroFactor: Object</neuro>

- An object in Awareness
- An object of your Attention

## Data Types

There is nothing too small to describe with code. Opening a water bottle can have a Phrase List

```py
for microsite in via:
    SpadeTest(microsite)

```

### <moto>List: Phrase</moto>

- Any Phrase

### Dict

#### <moto>MotoDict</moto>

-

#### <via>ViaDict</via>

-

#### <neuro>NeuroDict</neuro>

-
- Species Ratio
-

#### <eco>EcoDict</eco>

### Tuple

#### MotoTuple

-

#### ViaTuple

-

#### NeuroTuple

#### EcoTuple

### String

All spoken Beta are strings

For Loop

> The for statement is used to iterate over the elements of a sequence (such as a string, tuple or list) or other iterable object:

#### MotoLoop

```py
for move in movePhrase
    Via(move)


```

#### ViaLoop

```py
for  in



```

#### NeuroLoop

## Expression

### MotoExpression

The coverage control is a multi-agent system control method that governs agents to move toward the optimal placement based on a predetermined density function. Many applications of coverage control have been reported in many fields, such as

- In the future shrubs will be planted among crop trees to prevent soil erosion.
- In northern Alberta they plant Rhododendron Shrubs (locally known as Labrador Tea)

## Information Theory

ClaudeShannon

RockyLand has more information due to its unpredictable soil. CreamLand has less information than BadLand.

Only send what you can't predict

You don't need to communicate JugGrip you only need to communicate that you must use the JugHold.

You don't need to communicate ViaBody if you know ViaStart and ViaFinish.

## Tensor

Via is a Tensor

Curve

## Runtime

When is Plantbeta Running

## Compilation

Just in Time Compilation

## Microsoft

Fit Put(Plant) into Microsoft products by renaming it to Pylant.

### VScode

### Npm

### Windows

Apple doesn't allow PWA

### Excel

Most Planting companies probably already use Excel all the time. Many Planters keep their numbers in Excel.

## Packaging

How to create a package in Python?

## BatchProcessing

## BetaComposition

Slot in elements

Insert elements is more Polyglot

Inserting is an essential action of composition

## BOM Beta Object Model

Planters are constantly changing their Beta in RawLand,

Planters use the Virtual BOM only in their mind or in BetaApp.

A BetaDiagram is the BOM, a Planter

Virtual DOM is Virtual BOM

Virtual Document Object Model

Virtual Beta Object Model

Actual DOM is the Actual BOM

BetaCode

What renders the BOM?

Eco is not rendered but Neuro, Moto and Via are rendered

A virtual model is a model of a model

Randonner dans l'Ã‰co

Planter is the renderer

Feeling the ground without touching it, is

The BOM is rendered into 1st person experience. Thinking about ArmProp before ArmProp in reality.

The state of Via changes when a planter looks around or turns around like a South Pointing Cart

The html Elements aren't always added or removed but their values can change. The object which points to the cache is always present once you walk away from the cache, but it's value is constantly changing.

What is analogous to the browser?

The browser is still objects, when does Vue become real? Light

The real part a red svg circle is the red light

## Threads

The mind is single threaded

TeamBeta is multithread

Parallel or Concurrent

Follow is Parallel

What scope is parallel? Team can both be Backfilling but using different Theorem

## Examples

```py

>>> ZigzagPath(5)

# ZigzagPath a slope 5 wide

```
