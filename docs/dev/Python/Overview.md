The color of Python is the same as ðŸ› <dev>Dev</dev>

This is not BePython. Any part of representing code like Python is in Betagraphy

## BetaPython is Backend ([Betagraphy](/encyclopedia/Betagraphy/Overview) is Frontend)

BetaPython is not meant to be seen by users. Skilled Betatekts should have some understanding of the code.

BetaPython implements the creations of BETAGRAPHY

BetaPython is the Python package which is used to formally write BetaSystema.

BetaPython is a subset of BetaSystema. BetaSystema is the system of Beta how is used.

BetaPython only exists in computers, ie. you don't use BetaPython when you're not using the BetaApp.

BetaPython is behind the scenes. BetaSystema is implemented in BetaPython

BetaPython computes BetaMetron.

BetaPython is used to implement Betagraphy, BetaSkhema and BetaSimulation

BetaPython also stores data about Taxa by defining classes in python.

## Hardware Analogy

VisualCortex is larger than language areas.

Does visual cortex use vectors like ai?

Gpu is faster than Cpu

What are the advantages of cpu?

- energy cost

## Philosophy

::: tip Bjarne Stroustrup to Lex Fridman

> "Philosophy is important for C++ because you are determining what people can express and how. "

> "What can be outputted?"

> "What is the output what are the inputs and how are they processed? "

## Python

Use Python's syntax to code BETASYSTEMA.

```py
def Plant():
    

for Tree in Bag:
    Plant(Tree)

```

```py

for Bundle in Box:
    if BundleInverted == True:
        BundleFlip()
    else:
        BundlePeel

```

## Structure

### Phrase

> A dance phrase or sequence can be likened to a sentence formed when speaking. Sometimes we refer to dance phrases as moto sequences. For the purpose of this lesson either term is acceptable. Each phrase has a beginning, middle, and end. Motoments selected in a dance phrase may flow one to the other naturally or may be connected by a transition moto. Evolving dance sequences from action words is another way to demystify the creative process. Action words lead to the formation of individual dance phrases and provide the framework for further developing those phrases into larger compositional forms. In this lesson, the action words are common terms used in contemporary dance.

## Loop

```py

for Tree in bag:
    if ValidMicrosite:
        Put(Tree)
        Get(Tree)
    else:
        Test()
# test another Microsite

```

## Classes

```py

class Trench(PrepLand):
 

class SpadeSlam(Moto):
    def __init(self, MotoLocation)
```

### Instance Variable

> Variable created during object instantiation

A more accurate name for "variable" is "assignable" since many variables don't vary, they remain constant after being assigned a value

Instantiate and EcoType with an empty string for Via

```py



```

## Methods

See [BetaMethods](/encyclopedia/)

```py
def Put(PlantType: str, Location: str, TreeCount: int, TreeType: str, ScreefBoolean: bool):

```

### Put(Flag)

```py
def Put(Flag, FlagColor: str, FlagType: str, HandMove: str)
```

## ReservedWords

```py

ReservedWords = [
    
]

```

## State

State is the value of a variable at a given time or set of conditions.

Variables change their values. They are assigned a new value.

Changing Values

As you move through the land the EcoState is constantly changing. Remember that Eco is from the first person point of view. The Geology and Botany remains static, but Eco is relative to where you are in the land. The land under your feet is constantly changing.

> CurrentState

### EcoState

- TemperatureState
- TimeState
- EcoDensityState
- SoilState
- TopoState
    - SlopeAngle

### MotoState

- MotoState
- FatigueState

### NeuroState

- Vigilance
- Mindset
- Preparedness
    - Ready Set Go

### ViaState

- CurrentTheorem
- Direction
- ViaDensityState
- ViaSurfaceState

## Stack

> the last one in is the first one out

Bag

## Control Flow Statement

### Conditional Statement

#### If

#### Else

```py

def SpadeTest():
# find an EcoSurface to test    
    
    if(Subsurface != Rock):
        return true
    else:
        SpadeTest()
```

#### Exception

Do this except if this happens

```py

except

```

## Recursive beta optimization

- Optimization Sequence
- TopDown
- Choose the optimal beta, then optimize how you execute the beta

BETASYSTEMA is the website

You don't need to communicate Beta all the time, but when you do, BETASYSTEMA helps you to communicate it.

Beta is the syntax

Motos are the objects and functions

Plantbeta can be used in Planting and Climbing, on BETASYSTEMA.com and Klimbeta.com

## Syntax Highlighting

## HTML

### Vue.js

- Beta as XML tags used in BetaDiagram. Use Vue to create a custom component for each BetaTaxon

Render a `BetaList[]` as Vue components

#### Input

```py

BetaList = [
    Cover,
    Climb,
    Log,
    MinimumSpace,
    ArmPut
]

for object in BetaList:
    VueRender(object)

```

#### Output

```vue

<Beta>
    <Via>Cover</Via>
    <Moto>Climb</Moto>
    <eko>Log</eko>
    <Via>MinimumSpace</Via>
    <Moto>ArmPut</Moto>
</Beta>

```

:::

![PythonLogo](/Python/PythonLogo.png)

## What is Computation?

Define BetaType classes for BetaPython instead of UsePython. UsePython will change UI or state. BetaPython is implemented in humans, UsePython is implemented digitally.

BetaPython only outputs information that is designed to be read by humans. UsePython outputs non human readable information like JSON.

UsePython is a superset of BetaPython.

BetaPython has alot of f strings

class Arm(Moto):

> Computer

## Klimbeta.py

Climb({})

Insert the route

Route is composed of Via and Eco and sometimes Moto if for the StartPosition

Pass a Route as an argument to the Climb() method

Users can use a form instead of writing a dict

## BetaPython, Analogy between Python and BetaSystema

> Your best Python code won't even run digitally. It will be implemented in and by humans.

Be like a Dune mentat.

#### Return Value

Motos return force

MotoFunction

```py
def move(move{}, eco{}, via{}, neuro):
    force = (Submoto{} + Submoto{})
    return force
```

## Simulator

- Use Simulation to model motos. Ultimately the goal is to have a planter coded in Unity.
- 3D model of planter
- 3D model of all objects in BETASYSTEMA.
- So kids who game can learn the computations of Computational Planting, before they are old enough to work as a planter.

## Computational Neuroscience

## Computational Geometry

> Computational geometry is a branch of computer science devoted to the study of algorithms which can be stated in terms of geometry. Some purely geometrical problems arise out of the study of computational geometric algorithms, and such problems are also considered to be part of computational geometry.

### Graph Theory

- Nearest Neighbor
- Minimum Spanning Tree

### Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation

## Computer Science

- What are the computations that planters use?
- Just like Python, all objects in a planter's experience are objects.

## OOP

Object Oriented Programming

> A mathematical object is an abstract concept arising in mathematics. In the usual language of mathematics, an object is anything that has been (or could be) formally defined, and with which one may do deductive reasoning and mathematical proofs. Typically, a mathematical object can be a value that can be assigned to a variable, and therefore can be involved in formulas. Commonly encountered mathematical objects include numbers, sets, functions, expressions, geometric objects, transformations of other mathematical objects, and spaces. Mathematical objects can be very complex; for example, theorems, proofs, and even theories are considered as mathematical objects in proof theory.

I want to call BetaTaxa Elements to align with gymnastics, since they call their Gymnast units of performance Elements. `{ Gymnastics : BETASYSTEMA }`

All functions are Objects

A Moto is an Object of Movement

- ArmSwing()

An Eco is an Object of the Environment

- TrenchLand

A Neuro is an Object of the Nervous system

A Beta is an Object of BETASYSTEMA.

- Put() is a Beta
- Beta.Lingo()
    - BetaLingo is like print() or console.log()

When someone asks "What's your Beta?" you don't give them your Beta since Beta requires execution, instead you give them a description of Beta. All code is actually the movement of electricity, but it's represented as text. Really what the person is asking is "What is a description of your Beta?"

You can't speak about Via or Moto by themselves.

A Taxon is an Object of BETASYSTEMA.

- BetaTaxon and BETASYSTEMAElement have been confused. Beta can be applied to Climbing, BETASYSTEMA can not. You don't need Beta to climb. Beta is an abstraction layer on top of Climbing or Planting. Beta is the observation

- BETAMETRON

Beta is the method that you use, but also the communication of that method. There needs to be another word for the communication.

## Information Theory

ClaudeShannon

RockyLand has more information due to its unpredictable soil. CreamLand has less information than BadLand.

Only send what you can't predict

You don't need to communicate JugGrip you only need to communicate that you must use the JugHold.

You don't need to communicate ViaBody if you know ViaStart and ViaFinish.

## Packaging

How to create a package in Python?

## BatchProcessing

## BetaComposition

Slot in elements

Insert elements is more Polyglot

Inserting is an essential action of composition

## BOM Beta Object Model

Planters are constantly changing their Beta in RawLand,

Planters use the Virtual BOM only in their mind or in BetaApp.

A BetaDiagram is the BOM, a Planter

Virtual DOM is Virtual BOM

Virtual Document Object Model

Virtual Beta Object Model

Actual DOM is the Actual BOM

BetaCode

What renders the BOM?

Eco is not rendered but Neuro, Moto and Via are rendered

A virtual model is a model of a model

Randonner dans l'Ã‰co

Planter is the renderer

Feeling the ground without touching it, is

The BOM is rendered into 1st person experience. Thinking about ArmProp before ArmProp in reality.

The state of Via changes when a planter looks around or turns around like a South Pointing Cart

The html Elements aren't always added or removed but their values can change. The object which points to the cache is always present once you walk away from the cache, but it's value is constantly changing.

What is analogous to the browser?

The browser is still objects, when does Vue become real? Light

The real part a red svg circle is the red light

## Threads

The mind is single threaded

TeamBeta is multithread

Parallel or Concurrent

Follow is Parallel

What scope is parallel? Team can both be Backfilling but using different Theorem

## Examples

```py

>>> ZigzagPath(5)

# ZigzagPath a slope 5 wide

```
