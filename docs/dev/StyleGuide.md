## Classic Style

> The writer can see something that the reader has not yet noticed, and he orients the reader's gaze so that she can see it for herself.

You're already performing beta elements, you've just never labelled them before.

Beta is a description

They are currently capable of performing all beta, there are no prerequisites to performing beta. Know how beta works requires knowledge of many fields of science: geology, kinesiology, biology, psychology, physics, meteorology...

Show don't tell

Reader and writer are intellectual equals

## <dev>Semantics</dev>

::: warning

It's easy to get stuck on the linguistics and naming. You can think about it for hours while in the land. While sitting in front of a computer your time is better spent typing, not thinking about increasing the clarity. Just get it out, then you can edit.

:::

### (Woods)InteadOf([Forest, Plantation])

- Bushes are wood
- Flowers are not wood

### "Planting"

Planting= Planting Industry
Planting= Putting a Tree in the Ground

### "Plant"

Try to avoid PlantPlant plant a plant in the ground. InsertPlant

InsertPod

Plant= Put a Tree in the Ground

- Put

Plant= Organism from Plantae

### Keep it G

Euphemisms undermine Put(Plant) and open it up to unnecessary criticism

- CreamyLand
- "Cream out"
- "Slut in"
-

## <dev>LevelOfDetail</dev>

No Acronyms

Write complete sentences.

Point form is lazy. Think about all the coding documentation which is not easy to read. Too formal, too concise, humans don't process language like computers, point of view matters.

## <dev>ClassName</dev>

- PascaleCase

## <dev>Bilingual</dev>

 French,  English

## <dev>Grammar</dev>

### You, not them

Second person instead of 3rd person

### Article

#### "a" not "the"

> The definite article "the" is used before a noun to indicate that the identity of the noun is known to the reader. The indefinite article "a, an" is used before a noun that is general or when its identity is not known.

Good
> Obstacle within a Hole

Bad
> Obstacle within the Hole

### Tense

### Remember Punctuation

Periods

### Gender Neutral Pronouns

### Person

## Icon

Icons are only used to represent Objects or Functions.

### !Icon

Concept, Object Property

MotoTimeline is orange as a header but it is not prefixed with an Icon.

::: warning Incorrect Syntax
ðŸŸ <moto>Arm.ðŸŸ <moto>ArmPut()</moto></moto>

Only the ðŸŸ <moto>Arm</moto> object is prefixed with an icon. ArmPut is orange but has no icon

ðŸŸ <moto>Arm.<moto>ArmPut()</moto></moto>

:::

### Literal or Metaphorical

### Tree ðŸŒ²

### Face Icons

- Emotion
- Sleep

### Purpose(Icon)

- Visual Search
- For planters to use the Icons
- Each Icon can be easily handwritten, since electronics don't do well in extreme weather, in terms of breaking and in UX. You can't easily view a screen in summer sun, or rain, definitely not in snow.

The BetaModules are aliased as Icons.

::: tip ?
When is it useful for Icons to be monochrome outlines?
:::

### Ambifix for Page Title

### Postfix

- Postfix for

### Prefix

- Prefix for

### Icon Only

- Which renderer to use for Icons in images?
    - No shading

## <dev>Links</dev>

How many links is too many?

Every paragraph should have a link

## Grandiosity

### Oversell

### Scale

- Number of Plants
- Scope
- Timeline

### Urgency

### Hero

Save the Day

Planters are Heros. Many people commented on @antmos Instagram that he was a hero. People already naturally think it.

## Via

Should "via" be used as natural language? "Get to the next page via the link at the bottom of the page"

## <dev>ElementPageDesign</dev>

## <moto>MotoPage.BaseLayout</moto>

### Definition

> Brief Definition in Blockquote avoid using Via adjectives and other BetaModules

### Taxonomy

#### Moto.SubMoto

::: tip

Taxonomy will be useful for D3.js

It doesn't matter if nobody looks at it.

:::

- Subset of Moto

#### Moto.SuperMoto

- Superset of Moto

```py

ArmSwing.SuperMoto = ArmMoto

```

### Images

- Description of a useful image in mind's eye
- Link to image
- Link to PaperPhoto. Draw a rough sketch of the Moto, be sure to clearly Tag the sketch in the Head of the paper.
    - Capture then Upload the Photo with Phone

### Moto.Purpose

The purpose is usually affect other BetaElements

### Moto.AnteMoto

Syntax: `Moto.AnteMoto`

- How they transition to each other

### Moto.PostMoto

### Moto.Via

- How does this Moto interface with Eco?
- Where in the Via is this Moto performed?

### Moto.Eco

Where in Eco is this Moto performed and on what EcoFactor. Put "the ground" if necessary. Nothing is too obvious in formal languages!

### Moto.Neuro

- Control Flow Statements for alternative moves

### Moto.Error

- Any errors in ControlFlow
- MotoExecutionError
- Error which is caused by Eco
    - Soil Collapse
    - Wood breaking
- Error Recovery if possible
