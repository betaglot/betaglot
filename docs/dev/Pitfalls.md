What not to do

Could easily happen if you're not paying attention

Near Enemy

Uncanny

## $$$ Money will surely fuck up anything that relies upon it

BETAGLOT is not designed to feed families.

Don't lose touch reality. Money will always necessary, keep it a necessity not a luxury.

## CurseOfKNowledge

## Interview yourself film with GoPro

CurseOfKnowledge can apply to yourself. Do I really understand Betaglot as well as I did at each moment of insight? Memory degrades, humblingly, even when it's about the thing that you've spend your adult life working on

### Too many greek names

The purpose of using greek is to make Betaglot polyglot. Remember that most people haven't studied etymology.

## Avoid Professional Narcissim via Steven Pinker

Professional narcissism. Academics live in two universes: the world of the thing they study (the poetry of Elizabeth Bishop, the development of language in children, the Taiping Rebellion in China) and the world of their profession (getting articles published, going to conferences, keeping up with the trends and gossip). Most of a researcherâ€™s waking hours are spent in the second world, and itâ€™s easy for him to confuse the two. The result is the typical opening of an academic paper:

In recent years, an increasing number of psychologists and linguists have turned their attention to the problem of child language acquisition. In this article, recent research on this process will be reviewed.

No offense, but few people are interested in how professors spend their time. Classic style ignores the hired help and looks directly at what they are being paid to study:

All children acquire the ability to speak a language without explicit lessons. How do they accomplish this feat?

Of course, sometimes the topic of conversation really is the activity of researchers, such as an overview intended to introduce graduate students or other insiders to the scholarly literature. But researchers are apt to lose sight of whom they are writing for, and narcissistically describe the obsessions of their federation rather than what the audience wants to know.

Totally academic

Totally theoretical
