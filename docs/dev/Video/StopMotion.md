Diorama inclue Eko and Moto Armature

Sell the Diorama. Replicate the Beta exactly. Use AI to determine how close the submitted beta

You can test a person's Beta

Stop motion circumvents sex. Beta Videos can easily become sexualized.

Abstracted into StopMotion

## What is StopMotion

[Vox: How stop motion animation began](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80CKTOjjZFQ&list=WL&index=2&ab_channel=Vox)

## Ultimate Purpose

Animation of Beta is a powerful tool for learning Moto and Via.

Center of Mass for ViaPath

Claymation allows total control of Beta and is very easy to delegate. Some people dream of doing claymations as a profession, let them. Find them as students in School or Private Company. Any city in Canada or a country that you would want to visit often

## üêç<py>How can Python be used in StopMotion</py>

MoviePy

FrameRate

Make Gifs

## Framerate

Frames per second

## BetaInstance = BetaFrame = VideoFrame = PythonDataFrame

Each photo is a captures a single BetaFrame

One BetaFrame for each second. Duplicate if necessary

## Representing each BetaType

### Scale

Half Scale

- üü†<moto>AdultAthleteHeight</moto>: 0.8 m
- üü©<eko>WallHeight</eko>: 2.4 m (should be easy to find in Montreal)
-

Colors are the same as BETAGLOT theme.

### üî∑<beta>BETA</beta>

### üü©<eko>EKO</eko>

For tall routes use two walls which leapfrog

Tnuts?

#### Plasts made of Clay

Plasts should be cast so they are rigid enough to support Athlete and so they can be reused

Not plasticine

Also to get their color right. Get a tub of paint

Mix paint into the cast

#### Translucent

Acrylic translucent for CrackClimb Animation

And Motos within hole

#### CutAway

To see through Ekons

### üü†<moto>MOTO</moto>

#### <moto>ATHLETE is the Figure</moto>

Simplify goniogram joint label to dozen instead of 360

- Child sized (140cm)

- Adult Sized (168cm)
    - Recreate myself

- Tall Adult Sized (200cm)

For fun, make a Bonobo (not a chimpanzee) and a Gibbon

Sections can be removed for Paralympic. The Teknik of Paralymics is almost totally unexplored. Except for the guy at Allez Up.

#### <moto>ScapulaMoto is required</moto>

The Athlete needs Scapular movements, since ScapulaPosition is essential for safe biomechanics.

ScapulaMoto is required.

Laika achieves ScapulaMoto by having a collar bone segment.

Most armatures don't have scapula.

#### <moto>Close Ups of HandMoto and FootMoto</moto>

Hand is my hand, foot is simple enough to be created with clay

CloseUp of HandMoto is my hand painted orange with some black contour lines for definition around joints.

CloseUp of FootMoto with orange shoe made of Clay.

#### Replacements of Hands

Apparently puppet hands sometimes break so it's a good idea to make multiple copies of the hand

### üîª<via>VIA</via>

- Ribbon, Wire
- Red Masking tape to highlight ViaContact

### üíú<neuro>NEURO</neuro>

Thought Bubble

## Mimicry

### How Enthousiasmos will be easier than these Movies.

- Only one character
- No faces
    - No Lip movements
- No effects
    - fire, water, rain, snow, wind
- Only one character
- No hair or fur
- No detail on background

Laika films characters are the closest to Athlete

### Aardman

Easier than aardman because boulders only take a max of a couple mins

- Chicken Run

- Pinocchio

## Recreate Famous Beta

## Where to find animators in Montreal?

They need to be students, since pros are $$.

## Cinematography

### GoPro

Multiple Go Pro, ideally orthographic

3D model without any code

OpenSource software that turns video into 3D model

As a prototype make a camera mount on a loop ring demiring

Take video and Photo of each instance

4D video makes a 2D screen seem 3D

### Camera Mount

Isometric and orthographic mount

MountMoto

### Lighting

Light Color

#### Light direction must be standardized

- For coherence between shots, especially close up and medium shots

### StartWithEasy

- Recreate Beta that you've already performed and have video for
- No Close Ups
- Erase support in postproduction only if easy

Betaglot short are ideas in a person's mind like inside out stick figures
