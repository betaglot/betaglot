## Differentiate(WebsiteArchitecture, DirectoryStructure)

The Directory Structure is not the same as the UI Architecture.
Files from different folders can be contained within the same sidebar section.

The Directory Structure is for devs to use (Backend), while the UI Architecture is for Users (Frontend)

The Directory Structure is a Hierarchy, while the Architecture is a NetworkGraph.

> There are no links between directories and files, but there are tons of links on each page

Architecture:Page :: Directory:File

There are no pages in the directories, there are no files in UIArchitecture

A website is a building, while a directory is a filing cabinet
