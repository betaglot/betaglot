## Betagraphy is the Frontend

In Betagraphy, Betagraphers create Betagrams to represent Beta as an image..

Betagram: noun, a picture or diagram that gives information, especially one produced on a computer

A Routesetter is the person who implements a Betagrapher's Betagraphy

A Betagram isn't a list like musical notation, rather its a graph like a knowledge graph.

A Betagram can be a blob of connected nodes instead of a string of elements.

Time and sequence are too limiting. Movement Redundancy, alternative movements. Sometimes time and sequence are important to record, especially if Beta complements music or for kinematic physics. Release Time, Speed, Acceleration

## BETAGRAPHY uses Python Syntax combined with Scratch and XML

### XML

Xml read up by litany contiguous to

Same line as closing tag

Or overlaping

Startband finish tags

### Control Flow Structures

Loops

### BetaBlock

When a name is used in a code block, it is resolved using the nearest enclosing scope. The set of all such scopes visible to a code block is called the blockâ€™s environment.

A BetaBlock's environment.

LocalEco: PocketHold

GlobalEco: OverhangWall

### Scripts

Climbers write scripts while on the ground and use immediate mode while on the wall

Scripts are tested while on ground

Execution of scripts occurs On(PullOn)

### Debugger

BetaState

Debugger is a limiting name

Set Breakpoint

Hop on the route at any point during projecting
