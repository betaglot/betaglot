BETASYSTEMA is the system which is composed of ECO, MOTO, VIA, NEURO

The term Beta can refer to any of the BetaTypes. All TypeTaxa inherit from BetaTaxon, which is the Base class. EcoTaxon

The terms "Taxon" is used instead of "Object", since abstract objects are difficult to understand and will render BETASYSTEMA inaccessible to everyone who isn't a computer scientist or philosopher.
