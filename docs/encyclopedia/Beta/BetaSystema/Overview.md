BETAGLOT is the organization which is developing BETASYSTEMA.py and applying it to solo sports

BETASYSTEMA is the system which is composed of ECO, MOTO, VIA, NEURO

The term Beta can refer to any of the BetaTypes. All TypeTaxa inherit from BetaTaxon, which is the Base class. EcoTaxon

The terms "Taxon" is used instead of "Object", since abstract objects are difficult to understand and will render BETASYSTEMA inaccessible to everyone who isn't a computer scientist or philosopher.

## Differentiate(Theoria, Praktik)

Knowing how to solve a problem isn't the same as actually solving the problem. Knowing how to draw an equilateral triangle doesn't result in an actual triangle on paper. You must put the knowledge into practice.

You can't have Practice in the encyclopedia. Practice only exists in the Tutorial Section.
