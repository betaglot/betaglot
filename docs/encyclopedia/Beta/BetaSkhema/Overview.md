# ðŸ”·<beta>BETASKHEMA: EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED</beta>

BetaSkhema is not abstract, BetaSkhema is a graphic representation of Taxa relationships. The relationships themselves are defined as an Attribute of each Taxon.

BetaSkhema is not necessary for the existence of BetaSystema.

BetaSkhema can be used to represent new relationships between Taxa, the new relationships are only added to BetaSystem by updating BetaPython

Schemas also play a role in education and the learning process. For example:

- Schemas influence what we pay attention to. People are more likely to pay attention to things that fit in with their current schemas.
- Schemas also impact how quickly people learn. People learn information more readily when it fits in with the existing schemas.
- Schemas help simplify the world. Schemas can often make it easier for people to learn about the world around them. New information could be classified and categorized by comparing new experiences to existing schemas.
- Schemas allow us to think quickly. Even under conditions when things are rapidly changing and new information is coming in quickly, people do not usually have to spend a great deal of time interpreting it. Because of the existing schemas, people can assimilate this new information quickly and automatically.
- Schemas can change how we interpret incoming information. When learning new information that does not fit with existing schemas, people sometimes distort or alter the new information to make it fit with what they already know.
- Schemas can be remarkably difficult to change. People often cling to existing schemas even in the face of contradictory information.

### Database Schema Definition

A database schema refers to the logical and visual configuration of the entire relational database. The database objects are often grouped and displayed as tables, functions, and relations. A schema describes the organization and storage of data in a database and defines the relationship between various tables. A database schema includes descriptive details of the database that can be depicted through schema diagrams.

### How are database schemas designed?

Database designers create database schemas to help programmers interact with the database efficiently. The process of creating a database is known as data modeling. To design a database schema, you need to gather information and arrange them into tables, rows, and columns. You need to organize the information to make it easier to understand, relate, and use.

### What is database schema design?

Database schema design provides a blueprint to develop the architecture of the database, so a massive amount of information can be stored systematically. It also refers to the strategies and best practices involved in constructing a database. Database schema design makes the data much easier to consume, interpret, and retrieve by organizing it into separate entities and determining the relationships between organized entities.

### Types of Schema

- Physical database schema: The physical database schema represents the physical arrangement of data and how itâ€™s stored in blocks of storage such as files, indices, key-value pairs.
- Logical database schema: Logical database schema describes the logical representation of data and conveys logical constraints. The data can be described as certain types of data records and is stored as different data structures. However, internal details like data implementation are hidden at this level.

- Hierarchical model: A database schema with tree-like structures with child nodes attached to the root node is hierarchical. This database schema model can store nested data, including family trees.
- Flat model: A flat model organizes data into a single or two-dimensional array-like in a spreadsheet with rows and columns. The model is appropriate for simple data without complex relations that can be arranged in tabular format.
- Relational model: The relational model is similar to a flat model in which data is organized into tables, rows, and columns. However, in this model, you can define relationships between different entities.
- Star schema: A star database schema organizes data into "dimensions" and "facts." Dimensions include descriptive data, while facts have numeric values.
- Snowflake schema: The snowflake database schema is a logical representation of data in a database. The representation of this type of schema is similar to snowflake, where multiple dimensions are attached to a single centralized fact table.
- Network model: A network database schema includes data as multiple nodes connected. This model is used to accomplish specific tasks as it allows complex connections such as many-to-many relationships.
