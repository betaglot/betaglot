BETAGLOTS are people who apply the BETASYSTEMA to multiple sports

BETAGLOT is the organization which is developing BETASYSTEMA.py and applying it to solo sports

BETASYSTEMA is the system which is composed of ECO, MOTO, VIA, NEURO

The term Beta can refer to any of the BetaTypes. All TypeTaxa inherit from BetaTaxon, which is the Base class. EcoTaxon

The terms "Taxon" is used instead of "Object", since abstract objects are difficult to understand and will render BETASYSTEMA inaccessible to everyone who isn't a computer scientist or philosopher.

## Differentiate(Theoria, Praktik)

"Theory" is consistently misunderstood and misused. How to point this out without judgement? In the Ivory Tower is the last place that BETAGLOTs need to be.  

Knowing how to solve a problem isn't the same as actually solving the problem. Knowing how to draw an equilateral triangle doesn't result in an actual triangle on paper. You must put the knowledge into practice.

You can't have Practice in the encyclopedia. Practice only exists in the Tutorial Section.

> When we try to think our way out of bad situations to avoid getting hurt, we become engaged in trying to think of a solution instead of acting on one

> Use your Knowledge to act

It seems like there is a bias towards action instead of theory, like theory is somehow useless.

> That all sounds good in theory

The Theory of Gravitation is not useless, The Theory of Natural Selection is not useless. Architecture doesn't exist without
