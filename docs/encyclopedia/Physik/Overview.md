Is it useful to separate Mechanics into Kinematics and Dynamics, since Athletes mostly use Dynamics?

- Mechanics
    - Kinematics
        - Time
        - Velocity
        - Acceleration
        - Kinematic Equations
        - Displacement
    - Dynamics
        - Momentum
        - Inertia
        - Mass
        - Forces
        - Newton's Laws
        - Collision
