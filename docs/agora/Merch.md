Replicate a poster as a WebPage to make it more interactive by adding video

### BetaSkhema Poster

Highlight of attention on each element of BetaSkhema. Metadata. Concepts are not experienced, only conceptualizing is experienced. BetaElements are concepts. BetaImage within the center of a BetaInstance is closer to reality than lists, icon or words.

PostIt over the details like a kids book. Make a poster that can be interacted with. Like an advent calendar which reveals the details of an element

A poster is merely the frame for a dozen fold outs.

Sell handmade paper crafts instead of printable posters. It's a lot more difficult to replicate a paper craft than a poster.
