# ðŸ”·ðŸ”· BETATEKNIK

Beta Teknik describes the total difficulty of a Climber's performance.

Neuro is not scored in a BetaComp since it is difficult to observe directly and can be observed indirectly in the Move and <via>Route</via> of a Climber's performance. The only place where Neuro could be observed in a Climber is their emotional facial expressions, but Climbers are almost always facing the wall, so their face can't be seen.
