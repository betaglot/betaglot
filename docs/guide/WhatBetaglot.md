## What does <beta>Betaglot</beta> mean?

> beta + glot

"beta" comes from climbing. It is any information about how to climb something. The term beta is an abbreviation of Betamax, which was hardware used to record video, like a VHS cassette tape ðŸ“¼. Before the internet climbers would give each Betamax video tapes of climbs, so if you wanted to see a video of climb was performed you would ask for the "Beta". Although people no longer use tapes ðŸ“¼, the term is still used all the time.

"glot" literally means "tongue" in greek, or "language" metaphorically. So, betaglot means "the language of beta".

Betaglot is also related to "polyglot", which means that you can speak more than one language. A betaglot can speak the language of both tree planting and of climbing. Beta can be applied to any solo sport, that is, any sport where you're not directly competing against anyone, such as gymnastics, archery, whitewater kayaking, break dancing and more.

The greatest power of being a Betaglot is that you systematically translate your atheletic ability into money.
