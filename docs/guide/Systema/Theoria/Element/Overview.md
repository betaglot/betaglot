All Elements have Attributes and Methods

Attributes and Methods are not Elements

A method can be a Problema

## Types of Elements

- Symbols
    - The methods of symbols connect symbols to another
    - The methods of symbols is their semantics
- Axioms
- Definitions
- Propositions

## Element Combination

(Element_A + Element_B == Element_AB)

Arm + Swing == ArmSwing

Elements combined together become a new element, not a Compound like Chemistry.

## Element Composition

Sequence of Elements

```py
"Element" = AlsoKnownAs([
    "Class",
    "Object",
])

```
