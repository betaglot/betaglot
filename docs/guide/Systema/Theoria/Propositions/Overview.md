# Proposition

> Statemental logic studies the ways statements can interact with each other.

[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/propositional-logic-sentential-logic/)

A proposition is a statement which can be either true or false.

## Differentiate(Problema, Theorema)

- Both must be valid
- Both are statements

### ReturnStatement

- Problems are questions which must return an answer.
    - 'How to make an equilateral triangle' returns an equilateral triangle.
    - 'How to '
- Theorems don't return anything.
    - "If in a triangle two angles equal one another, then the sides opposite the equal angles also equal one another."

## Validity

> the quality of being based on truth or reason, or of being able to be accepted:

It is true that something is false.

## Connect Euclid and Python with Statements

All statements must be valid for them to run in Python.

### Python

> statements are instructions or commands that you write to perform specific actions or tasks

Taxon.Attributes are Theorems, while Taxon.Methods are Problems.

PythonStatements are closer to Problema than to Theorema.

Problema:
> a task, that which is proposed, a question

## What is the relationship between Classes and Statements?

> Each Statement is a Class?

> Statements contain instances of Taxa

Classes are composed of both Problems and Theorems

A ClassDefinition is a Theorem.

All Taxa are composed of Theorems(Attributes) and Problems(Methods)

(Problema !=== Problem), (Theorema !=== Theorem)

Problema and Theorema are a Subset of Problems and Theorems, they must be of type Beta

Each Taxa is acutally composed of multiple Statements, but in BetaSystema, Taxa are not called Statements. In the same way that all Functions in Python are actually Objects.

All definitions are actually propositions

What the class looks like.

How to perform the class.

Knowing what a HeelHook looks like is not the same thing as knowing how to perform a HeelHook. Both knowing and performing are contained within the HeelHook class.

At a different scope, *'HeelHooks can be used to traverse a ledge'* is a Theorem which itself is not a Taxon. Unless, like Python, everything is an Object (all objects are classes), so *'HeelHooks can be used to traverse a ledge'* is an class. If each unqiue combination of Taxa is a class, then there are millions of unqiue classes in BETASYSTEMA. Each class would be contained in a database table.

ðŸ”·<beta>*'HeelHooks can be used to traverse a ledge'*</beta> is a BetaStatement composed of instances of Taxa from multiple BetaTypes:

- ðŸŸ <moto>HeelHook</moto>
- ðŸ”»<via>Traverse</via>
- ðŸŸ©<eko>Ledge</eko>

BetaStatements are not Taxa, only the Statements of BetaTypes can be Taxa.

BetaStatements which haven't been proven true are Hypotheses. Proven Hypotheses are Theorems.
