## A system of Elements

Based on types of Elements in Euclids Elements:

- Axioma
- Symbols 🐍<py>Syntax</py>
- Definitions 🐍<py>ClassDefinitions</py>
    - Taxa 🐍<py>Class</py>
    - BetaType 🐍<py>Types</py>
- Propositions 🐍<py>Statements</py>
    - Postulates
    - Problema 🐍<py>Functions</py>
    - Theoria 🐍<py>Variables</py>
    - Hypothesis 🐍<py>DocStrings, Test</py>

Definitions have no proofs.

All Propositions must be proved

## Differentiate(Via, Moto)

### Confusion

ViaGravity as acceleration but not by force. Force is Moto

Split Newton Kinematics into Via or Moto

## Differentiate(Via, Eko)

### Confusion

## Dependencies

### Instances of Dependencies

Instances of Definitions, Symbols, previous  occur in Propositions

Anteproposition is a proposition which occurs before the current proposition

Dependency can refer to any Element type

### Linear Dependency (A hierarchy)

#### Deductive Axiomatic System

### Interdependent (A network)

they all depend on each other
