"Beta Dance"

Khoros (noun): Dance, Choreography

::: danger ðŸ›  ðŸ›  ðŸ›  ðŸ›  ðŸ›  ðŸ› 
BETAKHOROS is NOT currently being developed, since the other more simple types of BETATHLON must be implemented and tested before BETAKHOROS will be able to take place.

## What?

A BETAKHOROS competition is not currently possible, but not impossible in the future.

There are too few, if any, Climbers who have attempted to climb to music. The closest thing to a BETAKHOROS occurs in the performances of the Cirque Du Solei. Most of their Climbing isn't performed on a Wall and often involves elements unrelated to Climbing, such as the trampoline in this video.

### Music

No Climber is good enough to climb to music, but after a few years of BETATHLON Climbers will probably be able to climb to a simple beat.
