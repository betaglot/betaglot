## Greek Chorus

[Written by MasterClass](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/greek-chorus-guide)

> A Greek Chorus is a theatrical device originating in ancient Greek theater involving a small group of performers—who are usually unrelated to the central action of a story—commenting on the central action of a play. The chorus speaks directly to the audience and may not interact with the main characters of a story at all. Their purpose is to underscore the moral themes, actions, character development, and messages of a story to the audience

### Purpose of a Greek Chorus

- Provides commentary on the action of a play: Chorus members commenting on the themes, messages, and unseen action of a play helped to guide audiences to understand the intended progression of a narrative. Ancient Greek theater typically involved one actor playing many different roles, and the Greek chorus helped to clarify what was going on.
- Draws the audience in: The Greek chorus addresses the audience directly, often engaging in wry commentary seeking to let the audience in on privileged information.
- Expresses a characters’ inner thoughts: The Greek chorus is able to reveal a main character’s emotions and motivations to the audience, even when they are trying to hide them.
- Gives principal actors a moment offstage: Choral interludes allowed actors in ancient Greece a moment to change backstage, often with actors playing multiple characters needing a breather.
