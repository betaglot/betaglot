# 🔷🔻 <eco>Route</eco> Intensity Score

## Definition

### Relationship between <eco>Route</eco> Intensity and <moto>Moto Intensity</moto>

Routes determine the minimum intensity of a move.

Climbers can perform a really intense move which is more intense than it needs to be.

- Climbing with <moto>TRexArm</moto> is more intense than ArmHang with straight arms, both are performed on the same route.

- Holds that are far apart are HighIntensity due to the large distance between them. A Tall Climber can ArmReach with LowIntensity while a ShortClimber must <moto>Dyno</moto> with HighIntensity for the same route. Does this mean that Via Intensity is relative to climber? No, the Beta is more intense but the Via Intensity stays the same. Beta is more intense for ShortClimber than TallClimber.

- <eco>Route</eco> Intensity is independent of MotoIntensity.

- MotoIntensity depends on ViaIntensity.

### Relationship between Via Intensity and Neuro Intensity
