# What is a ðŸ”¶<moto>BETATHLON</moto>?

A BETATHLON is a **group** of Climbing competitions which test a Climber's [<beta>Beta</beta>](/guide/What/WhatBeta), not just a Climber's ability to complete a [<eco>Route</eco>](/reference/Via/ViaOverview) or how fast they can complete a [<eco>Route</eco>](/reference/Via/ViaOverview).

BETATHLON mimics the competition structures of other Olympic Sports. Following the names of other  sports, in the Olympics BETATHLON would be called "*Freestyle* Climbing" (like *Freestyle* Skiing) or "*Artistic* Climbing" (like *Artistic* Gymnastics).

::: tip Even if a BETATHLON never makes it into the Olympics, it will still [provide value](/guide/Why/AddValue) to the Climbing community and beyond.

You don't need to have a formal competition hosted by a gym to compete in a BETATHLON!
