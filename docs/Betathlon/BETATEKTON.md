## What is Betatekton?

Betatekton is inspired by Bauhaus. "Bauen" is a germanic word which means "to build", "to construct", "to make", so the direct translation would be "Beta Making".  

> One of the main objectives of the Bauhaus was to unify art, craft, and technology, and this approach was incorporated into the curriculum of the Bauhaus.
