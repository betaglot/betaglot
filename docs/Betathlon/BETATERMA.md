## Meaning of TERMA

### Origin

Terma: end, boundary, culmination, highest point

The Beta of where the climbing **term**inates.

FinishLine

FinishHold

Start to Finish

Endpoint

Endzone

Past the goal posts

### Teleology

---

A BETATERMA is the easiest BETATHLON type to understand and run, since it is the most similar to current Climbing Competitions.

## What is a BETATERMA Competition?

A BETATERMA competition is a climbing competition where climbers get [one attempt](/reference/BETATHLON/BETATERMA#onsight-only) to climb a <eco>Route</eco> and are scored on How they climb the Route.

A <eco>Route</eco> is chosen and Climbers are scored on the difficulty of the <moto>Moves</moto> and execution of the <moto>Moves</moto> that they perform on the  <eco>Route</eco> .

BETADROME Competitions are similar to BETATERMA competitions since they both test **HOW** a climber climbs a <eco>Route</eco> and not **IF** a climber can climb the  <eco>Route</eco> .

Both the [<via>Via</via>](/reference/Via/ViaOverview) and the [<moto>Moves</moto>](/reference/Moto/MotoOverview) that the Climber must execute are [fixed](/reference/Lexikon#fixed).

::: tip
Climbers are expected to be able to complete the  <eco>Route</eco>
:::

### [Onsight](/reference/Lexikon#onsight) Only

In a BETATERMA competition, each Climber gets **only one** [Attempt](/reference/Lexikon#attempt) per Route.

Attempt starts when climber makes contact with <eco>Route</eco> with **any part** of their body.

### ‚è≥ Timelimit

Each Climber has 50 seconds to view the <eco>Route</eco> from the ground without contacting it.

After a climber's <neuro>viewing</neuro> time is over, the climber has 10 seconds to start the  <eco>Route</eco> .

Once on the <eco>Route</eco> the Climber has a maximum of 2 minutes to complete the  <eco>Route</eco> .

Resting on the <eco>Route</eco> can reduce a Climber's Execution Score.

### Similar BETATHLON Competitions

- [<beta>BETAKLONE</beta>](/reference/BETATHLON/BETAKLONE)

## Who?

- A group of climbers who can climb a minimum <eco>Route</eco> grade.
    - Since BETATERMA competitions expect all climbers to complete the <via>routes</via> in the competition, even climbers that can only climb relatively easy <via>Route grades</via>  can compete against each other.

## Where?

## Implementation

- Climbers can practice on the <eco>Route</eco> before the competition.
- Get required Judges.
- Advertise Competition on Social Media and Poster

- Set the <via>Route(s)</via>
- Print all Scoring Sheets

- When to Brush Holds during competition?
- Determine how many rounds based on the number of climbers and Routes.

- Post Scores

### How can Climbers train for a BETATERMA Competition?

Climbers need to familarize themselves with the [<beta>BetaElements</beta>](/reference/Beta/WhatBetaSystem#BetaElements) in the [Reference Section](/reference/RefOverview).

Climbers need to understand the basics of [<beta>BetaScore</beta>](/reference/Score/Overview).

### How do Betatekt set the Competition?

### What is the Judging process for a BETATERMA Competition?

How many Judges?

## Why?

To see who can climb with the greatest ease

Effortlessly

### Test Climbing Technique Instead Of Musclar Strength

To make climbers who's <beta>technique</beta> far surpasses their <moto>brute strength</moto>

- A Climber who can crush a V9 could lose to a climber who can only Climb V3, if the V3 climber <beta>finds the optimal Beta</beta>, while the V9 Climber just relies on their <moto>muscular strength</moto>.

- It's very easy to climb an easy <eco>Route</eco> with [inoptimal](/reference/Scoring/Overview#) <beta>form</beta>.

### What is BETATERMA testing?

- Ability to plan how to Read the route. Since Climbers only have 50 seconds to look at the <eco>Route</eco> before starting, they must efficiently plan how they read the route.
    - Where the <via>Route Starts</via> and <via>Route Finishes </via>
    - What Moves they need to perform

- Ability to [<beta>Onsight</beta>](/reference/Lexikon#onsight)
    - React to Errors
    - Decide which <beta>Beta Alternatives</beta> to choose.

### Benefits for Climbers

Increases Climber's Ability to [<beta>RouteRead</beta>](/reference/Beta/BetaAction/ReadBeta#route-reading) since BETATHLON [integrates](/guide/Why/Value#integrates) [setting](/officials/Setter/Overview) into Climbing so that Climbers can gain a [<neuro>better understanding</neuro>](/reference/Eco/EcoOverview) of what the setting team's [<beta>intended beta</beta>](/reference/BETATHLON/BETAKLONE) is.

Increases Climber's ability to find the easiest <eco>Route</eco> in an <eco>Eco</eco>.

Climbers can compete against other climbers at their same level.

Novice Climbers can beat ExperiencedClimbers.

TallPerson Beta and Short Person Beta becomes irrelevant, so kids can compete against adults.

### Benefits for Betatekt

Betatekt can mislead Climbers.

Since Climbers only have one attempt, Betatekt can experiment in creating <via>false routes</via>, just like on <eco>Rock</eco>. Often when Climbers are climbing on <eco>Rock</eco> they have many potential <eco>EcoSurfaces</eco> which could be used as <via>ViaSurfaces</via> but are not necessary and can actually take climbers [<via>OffRoute</via>](/reference/Lexikon#offroute)

### Benefits for Coaches

### Benefit for Gyms

Gyms benefit from BETATERMA competitions by increasing the accessiblity

Climbers are divided into <via>RouteGrades</via>
