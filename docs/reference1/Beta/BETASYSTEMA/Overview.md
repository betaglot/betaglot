BETAGLOT is the organization which is developing BETASYSTEMA.py and applying it to solo sports

BETASYSTEMA is the system which is composed of ECO, MOTO, VIA, NEURO

The term Beta can refer to any of the BetaFactors. All Factors inherit from BetaElement, which is the Base class. EcoElement

The terms "Element" is used instead of "Object", since abstract objects are difficult to understand and will render BETASYSTEMA inaccessible to everyone who isn't a computer scientist or philosopher. Element is also an allusion to Euclids Elements of Geometry.
